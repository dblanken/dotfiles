## Features
### Dotfiles
A set of dotfiles I've been working on for almost a year now.  Characteristics include:

- Clipboard pasting.
- Full mouse support (pane/split resizing, scrolling, text selection) in Vim and tmux.
- Bundles a (not-excessive) number of useful Vim plug-ins, geared toward Ruby developers.
- Relatively restrained Bash config; has CDPATH to scripts and ~/code, command elapsed time printing, etc.
- Comprehensive Hammerspoon configuration

### Keyboard customization
On macOS, Karabiner-Elements is used for the following:
- Make Caps Lock serve as Escape when tapped and Left Control when chorded with another key.
- Make Return serve as Return when tapped and Right Control when chorded with another key.
- Toggle Caps Lock on by tapping both Shift keys simulatneously.

### Prompt
Bash is configured with the following prompt:

```sh
[i] !dblanken@Raistlin new_dotfiles [master‚óè] 0.06s $
```

Visible above are:

- Indicator of vi-mode in the terminal
  - [i] - Insert mode
  - [n] - Normal mode
- username (red ! if last command returned an error code)
- hostname
- current directory
- Git version control worktree status using colors that atch those used in git status:
  - Green dot indicates staged changes.
  - Red dot indicates unstaged changes.
  - Blue dot indicates untracked files.
- Execution time of the last command (if greater than 5s).
